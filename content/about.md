Hey there! My name is Arsh. Across the cyberspace, you'll also find me as **@RinkiyaKeDad** in many places. I'm a Developer Experience Engineer at [Okteto](https://www.okteto.com/). I enjoy building software, technical content, and communities! 

![its a me](/itsame.jpg)

You can find (most of) my conference talks [here](/speaking). If you want to read some of my articles, you can head [here](/writing). Links to all my socials are on the [home page](/). The most reliable way to reach me is to send an email to hey@arshsharma.com.

### Work Experiences
Not a big fan of duplicating information. If you want to read more about my past work, you can head over to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arsh4/).
