### How To Customize It as per Your Need:
Below are detailed instructions on how to customize this to your taste in case you're new to this. I'd love to see your variations and feature them here so feel free to send them to me. Also all suggestions are welcomed. In case you liked this or end up using it I ask nothing, but a mention or a star on the repo would be nice for sure :)
#### Guide to customizing to your need:
##### 1. Changing the landing page colors:
Go to src/components/BackgroundNew/style.css

Replace "rgb(0, 207, 17) 50%, rgb(0, 135, 224) 50%" with any two colors you'd like.

##### 2. Add your name and typography:
Go to src/components/FrontPage/FrontPage.js

Replace YourName with your name. You can also go ahead and change the stuff in "steps" to set what you want to see in typography.

##### 3. Add your photo
Go to src/static

Replace mainPhoto.png with your photo and remember to keep the name of your photo as mainPhoto.png

##### 4. Add your About Me
Go to src/components/AboutPage/AboutPage.js

Replace the content in

with what you want to. I'd suggest you dont change the post script so that people know that the component is clickable.

##### 5.Add your Socials
Go to src/components/AboutPage/AboutPage.js

Change the url in with your desired url.

##### 6. Add your Projects
Go to src/components/PortfolioPage/PortfolioPage.js

Replace project names. The url for the github repo goes in anchor tag () before the image and for the live preview goes in the second anchor tag.
